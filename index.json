This video is intended to highlight the “simplicity” of Lobe. It is also posted on social media to let more people know about Lobe.\nThe motion graphics in this video were all created using Apple Keynote and edited in Adobe Pr. The voice parts are generated by AI and supplemented with emotional adjustments.\nThis video is for non-commercial use only.\n· Sound Design # Re-Design Quantum Break trailer # This is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve created an audio redesign for a video, and I did my best to present the parts I wanted to show in the video. For example, using different styles of soundtracks for the live action and gameplay footage to make a distinction. I think the most important thing in sound design is to support the emotion of the image, and to maintain the storytelling of the image through the dimension of sound.\nAudio re-designed except for the Vocal dialog. SFX material from the internet, BGM designed by myself (partially using material from Logic\u0026rsquo;s Apple repository)\nBGM edited in Logic Pro; SFX edited in Ableton Live\nThis video is for non-commercial use only.\nOrginal Video: Quantum Break Live Action Villains trailer\nGame PV (Impressions \u0026amp; Elements) # The video is intended to be visually tense and scary, and the audio is designed to support this intent. The first step was to define the overall tempo and match the audio to the video. The next step is to control the progression of emotions and gradually increase the tension through the audio.\nThe material is partly from the Internet.\nThis video is for non-commercial use only.\n· Music Arrangement # イントロダクション Band Cover # If the video doesn\u0026rsquo;t play properly, visit my bilibili channel https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1me411c7Qm\nForeword\nI hope this ‘Introduction’ can become the introduction of everyone\u0026rsquo;s youth.\nIt was a constant reminder of the importance of close friends. To meet them is a miracle in itself.\nFor this Video Production # The lyrics and melody of this song are full of youthfulness, so when I first heard it, I was already unforgettable about it. I am also grateful to have such a group of friends willing to cooperate with me to complete this work.\nFor the performance part, I initially wanted to use a score that was readily available on the Internet, but I found some differences between it and the original score when I actually played it, so I chose to create my own score for the keyboard part. This time, the keyboard consists of two main parts, one is the piano part, and the other is a sound similar to the synthesis of String+Saw. Not very difficult overall, but very distinctive! At the same time, I tried to play at the beach during this video recording. Although there were many people around, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any stage fright at all. It was also a self-improvement experience, wasn\u0026rsquo;t it ?\nFor the video production part, At the beginning of the production, I wanted to make an \u0026ldquo;ACG\u0026rdquo; style performance video. After searching the internet, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find any similar videos. I had no choice but to try to add the elements I had in mind. Many of these elements are hand-drawn, such as some small animations. It is also the first time to try this kind of frame-by-frame drawing, and the process is still very interesting. For this type of music performance video, I think the most important thing is to get the rhythm right. Let the video switch with the audio rhythm, so as to maintain a sense of consistency and enhance the audiovisual experience of the audience. Since the performance of my Macbook is not enough to support me to use Adobe Ae to create many effects, I have to use Adobe Pr with Apple Keynote to finish the animation of some scenes. Although the production is a little complicated, but the finished product is still satisfactory. All in all, it was a very good attempt!\nThis is the best video I\u0026rsquo;ve done so far~\nAnd this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve done this type of band ensemble video. Thankfully, the finished product is quite respectable!\n又三郎 (Matasaburou) # If the video doesn\u0026rsquo;t play properly, visit my bilibili channel https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fU4y1j7kR\nForeword\nThis song is based on a fairy tale written by Japanese national author Kenji Miyazawa, \u0026ldquo;Kaze no matasaburo\u0026rdquo; .\nLegend has it that around September 1st, Matasaburo, the \u0026ldquo;son of the wind god\u0026rdquo;, will come to earth, and on that day, a new student named Saburo actually appears in class. When the children were talking about him and the mountain breeze was blowing outside the window, everyone rightly suspected that he was the KazeNoMatasaburo.\nAfter reading this fairy tale as a child, the author, n-buna, believed, like the child, that Saburo was the \u0026ldquo;son of the wind god\u0026rdquo;. But when he grew up and opened the fairy tale again, he found that Saburo seemed to be just an ordinary child from the city, and that he might just be out of place in the remote countryside.\n\u0026ldquo;If Matasaburo could really summon the gale, maybe he could blow away the sense of isolation in our hearts.\u0026rdquo; With this thought in mind, n-buna wrote the song \u0026ldquo;Matasaburo\u0026rdquo;.\nFor this Video Production # When I first heard this song, I was quite fond of his music and lyrics. Among them, for the guitar part of the arrangement, I have to say is fantastic, the melody is very dynamic. So I quickly adapted it to a piano version and played this piece.\nFor adapting the piano version, I needed to ensure not only the playability of the piece, but also to restore the style of the original as much as possible. Therefore, I gave serious thought to many areas, making the finished product very interesting.\nFor the post-production part of the video, I also added a lot of my own ideas and took a bold approach to these ideas. First of all, I need to think how to shoot the performance part, which needs to reflect the vividness of the performance, but also needs to ensure the neatness and usability of the picture. Secondly, since it was a music video, I also needed to think about how to combine the video with the rhythm of the audio when editing to make sure that the two didn\u0026rsquo;t feel strange. Then, I also added a lot of video clips that I shot to enhance the visual experience of the whole work, and experimented a lot with the color adjustment of the video.\nIn the audio post part, I focused on adjusting the piano tone to make it very distinctive and impressive.\nThis is my very favorite work\nThis arrangement also has a demo version of the score https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1p44y187xB/\n3 Pianos - Fight Song # If the video doesn\u0026rsquo;t play properly, visit my bilibili channel https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1za411C7yH\n\u0026ldquo;My power\u0026rsquo;s turned on\nStarting right now I\u0026rsquo;ll be strong\nI\u0026rsquo;ll play my fight song\u0026rdquo;\nWhat is the Fight Song? # For me, this song has been with me through many difficult times. Whenever I hear it, I can always jump out of the doldrums and start to fight in my own way. Cause I\u0026rsquo;ve still got a lot of fight left in me.\nThe only way I can thank this song is by adapting it. And here is it~\nFor this Video Production # In order to show the special atmosphere of the different parts of the song, I chose to use three sets and lighting to complete the work\nAt the beginning, I was using a normal upright piano without any digital functions. But to improve the audio quality, instead of using a recording, I used the AI audio transcription project to convert the performance to MIDI and used the same software Instrument on the computer as behind. It makes the overall listening experience very consistent without any abruptness.\nFor the main song and chorus, I chose to use the keyboard with the iPad\u0026rsquo;s drums for the performance. It can reflect both the production process of this music and the dynamics of the whole song.\nIn the interlude, I chose to use a reading light at night to create a quiet atmosphere and to better reflect the emotion of the piece.\nIn the closing section, I deliberately highlighted the visual center in order to better reflect the unyielding feelings that I wanted to express in the song. To give the audience a feeling of never giving up.\nExtra : I also added synthesizers, guitars, and bass to the whole piece, making it sound more unique and personal\n· Digital Tutorial # Digital Piano Recording Tutorial # Since this is a Chinese video, I haven\u0026rsquo;t uploaded it to youtube yet, but I\u0026rsquo;m working on an English version of it, so stay tuned!\nForeword\nAlong with the development of information technology, the camera capacity of mobile devices such as cell phones has increased substantially, and more and more people are recording piano videos. However, in the process of browsing videos online, it is found that many people do not make good use of the characteristics of digital pianos to improve the audio quality of their videos, for example, many people use the microphone of their cell phones to record the sound emitted by the speakers of digital pianos, making the audio really bad. Therefore, I would like to share my recording methods to more people by summarizing my own recording experience in order to improve their audio quality.\nFor this Video Production # It took quite a long time to design and prepare this video, almost six months. I took what I know about the excellent methods and took the viewer through the beginner\u0026rsquo;s perspective to learn these recording methods from the shallow to the deep.\nIn the beginning of the video, I first introduce the different types of digital pianos to help the novice to understand the characteristics of their instrument.\nIn the second part, I briefly introduce the meaning of related technical terms, such as MIDI and audio waveform, and introduce the corresponding recording methods according to the classification of the instrument\u0026rsquo;s interface and functions. I will provide pictures of each interface as examples to facilitate the user\u0026rsquo;s identification, while in some parts of the operation of the computer software, I will pay attention to the rhythm of the explanation and zoom in on the area I am operating in the video so that the user can do the correct operation with me.\nIn the third part, I introduce the different soft sources and how to use them to help users better grasp the characteristics of the corresponding sources to make better choices.\nIn making this video, I spent a considerable amount of time gathering information and preparing the corresponding read-aloud text and presentation slides. During this process, I kept thinking about how to better teach these knowledge and methods from a novice\u0026rsquo;s perspective, and I kept revising my material. I am quite satisfied with the final product, and I have gained a lot of support and love from people (this video has 22K+ views)\nAI Piano Transcription Tutorial # For Ubuntu # Test Platform\nSystem: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS\nCPU: i9-9880H\nRAM: 4GB\nHypervisor: VMware Fusion\nFor macOS # Test Platform\nSystem: macOS Mojave 10.14\nCPU: i9-9880H\nRAM: 4GB\nHypervisor: Parallels Desktop\nForeword\nI hope that all cutting-edge technologies will not just exist in papers, but that they will be accessible to all\nFor this Transcription Project # Out of my love for music, I often play many of the pieces I hear on the Internet on the piano. But the fact is that not all of them are found in sheet music. So I will try to make a score by listening to it. Since I am a novice, sometimes I can\u0026rsquo;t write the right notes exactly when I encounter a complicated piece. Then this is where the AI piano transcription project comes into its own.\nIt can accurately identify the notes. Whether it is a simple pop piece or a complex classical piece, it can handle it with ease.\nIt also accurately reproduces the pedals of the music. Its accuracy makes it infinitely closer to the original when playing back the transcribed music.\nIt has a fast transcription rate. With the help of CUDA acceleration, a 3-4 minute piece of music can be transcribed in less than half a minute. Even if it runs only with CPU, the speed is not too slow.\nFor this Video Tutorial # For this tutorial, I am also starting from a beginner\u0026rsquo;s point of view. It was tested at least three times with the complete process before recording the video. Each time, the virtual machine was uninstalled and reinstalled to ensure a pure system environment. I also invited my friends to follow my installation instructions and test them, and the feedback I got was no problem!\nWhen I browsed other computer tutorial videos on the web, I found that when they entered the code, the interface was always small making it hard to see what I was typing. So when I was making this video, I enlarged each code entry for the viewer to see clearly, and added extra code captions to increase the visibility of the code.\nNot only that, but I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that in many courses on the web, the audio recorded by the instructor\u0026rsquo;s microphone is always terrible, either too low or very noisy. So for the Ubuntu video, I chose a quiet environment and used a high quality microphone for the recording to ensure the quality of my audio. Having good video and audio quality allows both the learner and the viewer to enjoy the video.\nAlso, I have prepared a text version of the tutorial for those viewers who find watching videos inefficient.\nAnd here is it\nUbuntu: https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv15748307\nmacOS: https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10682214\nAnd this AI Transcription Project: https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/piano_transcription_inference\nPage Replacement Algorithms # Foreword\nI want all my courses to be from the point of view of a beginner or a student, with vivid animations and slides to make them learn and understand the knowledge better.\nFor this Video Production # The reason for making this video is actually that many students came to ask me about this knowledge point during the final exam revision phase. After the exam, while the memory was clear, I made this video immediately, and at the same time, I also considered to consolidate this knowledge point better.\nFirst of all, this is the age of short videos, and everyone likes concise, no-nonsense videos. Therefore, I try to make all the knowledge points as concise as possible when writing the script, so that the audience can understand and absorb the knowledge in the shortest time.\nWhile crafting the presentation slides, I recognized the benefits of using slides: their capacity to animate content, which can vividly illustrate abstract concepts, thereby enhancing comprehension for the audience. Consequently, I incorporated numerous animated transitions between slides and included several hand-drawn illustrations to clarify complex ideas.\nIn terms of audio, I also try to ensure that the recording is as high quality as possible, so that the audience will not be affected by inaudible learning efficiency. Unlike other tutorial videos, I have also added background music to make the overall video less rigid and boring.\n","date":"24 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/portfolio/portfolio_three_video/","section":"Posts","summary":"With hearing and seeing, I want to convey the feelings in my heart, and hope to awaken the initial love of people.","title":"Video \u0026 Music Collection","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/graphic-design/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Graphic Design","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/poster/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Poster","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/poster-collection/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Poster Collection","type":"categories"},{"content":" Graphic Design # MEMORRO · PolyU Design Show Booth # Booth Main Poster Specification: Width=1475mm, Height=1680mm Booth Desktop Specification: Width=1475mm, Length=455mm Booth Bottom Specification: Width=1475mm, Height=760mm Design software：Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Canva\nThis image of the MEMORRO project team\u0026rsquo;s booth backdrop creates a strong contrast between the bright red and black colors.

The school building that has been with me for four years is now with me in another virtual world in another form.\nVideo Production # At the beginning, there were no sketches and scale drawings, and the modeling was done only by impression. However, as the details increased a little, I found that some iconic places in my memory were still missing, such as the special window on the left side of the school building, and the sculpture on the square. Gradually restored that place where I studied inside day and night, it was like home.\nFor modeling, I hardly used other people\u0026rsquo;s models in this scene, just through the geometry combination and material design to restore the scene.As much as possible to achieve the meaning of originality.\nFor video production, this time I used UE4\u0026rsquo;s built-in camera and sequences. Because I have a basic knowledge of Ae and Pr, UE4\u0026rsquo;s video production interface is very familiar and intuitive, which makes me get started quickly. The action that kept repeating was: moving the camera\u0026rsquo;s 3D position, then setting keyframes. The zoom of some special shots is to highlight the wonderful visual feeling.At the same time, the variable speed in some places is also to achieve the right amount of detail in the video content, cuz I want to show this work to the audience as well as possible.\nDream Home # Modeling software : 3D Studio Max (2020)\nThis is a home design piece that uses the common apartment type. When designing the color scheme, I try to use materials of similar colors to make the whole more harmonious, without making it a strange mixture.\nLiving Room # First, I built a TV set because I love to enjoy great movies and TV shows, and they always bring me visual and auditory enjoyment.\nHonestly,I am very passionate about sports, especially bicycles, so I have placed a bike next to the TV. Also, I like music very much. When I am very stressed, I my favorite way for releasing the stress is playing the piano. Whenever I come back from school, I am always very tired and the place I enjoy most is this couch, because it can bring me happiness.\nStudy \u0026amp; Bedroom # For those who like art, waking up in the morning to see a painting of their beloved will certainly be a good mood all day. At the same time, a comfortable bed with a soft pillow is a guarantee of quality sleep every day, making life and work are better!\nWhether the home design is excellent, the ability to store items is a criterion that cannot be ignored.
